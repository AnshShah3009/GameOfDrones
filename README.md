Design and Development of a semi-automated drone

![quad image](

Our drone is a quadcopter. We started making the quadcopter around mid september. It uses a flight controller Naze32 rev6 full version as its brain.  The function of the flight controller is to give electronic signals to the Electronic Speed Controllers (Simonk 30A) which in turn provide voltage across the Brushless DC motor (A2212 1400kv). Drone uses a 3 cell orange lipo 5200mah as its power source. All the Electronic Speed Controllers are connected in parallel across the battery via a Power Distribution Board (pdb). We are using propellers of size 8 inch and 4.5 inch pitch. Droneâ€™s body is made up of 2 aluminium pipes and a face plate in order to mount Electronics on top of it. Chassis weighs about 335gm without electronics. Aluminium 1.5 cm strips of 3 mm thickness are bent and used as landing gear because it is required that on landing the landing gear must absorb most of the impact reaction. 


Drone chassis
The drone is manually controlled via a transmitter receiver pair (FSi6X and FSiaB10) which has 10 channels used to control quadcopter motors and other modes offered by the flight controller during flight. 

The competition we are going for this December (Operation Rahat) requires a QR code scanning and a package drop mechanism. We are using Raspberrypi 3B+ with picamera to do QR code scanning and a simple servo-hinge mechanism to deal with dropping mechanism.
